# inTouch

InTouch is a platform with two user flows depending on whether the user is part of an organization or a person seeking help. In order to seamlessly connect both parties, the inTouch app features an integrated chat system, secure video calling, and a calendar for scheduling appointments.

The video call feature will utilize the BOSE Pinpoint Noise Filter to help both sides communicate easily, regardless of background noise or distractions. It will also allow for background blurring for added privacy.

In the video chat Notes section, users can document reminders and next steps from their video conversation and create a to-do list. This allows organization-users to keep track of client conversations and draft appropriate follow-up communications, and it provides client-users a place to easily refer to the next steps and check items off as they complete them.

There is also a page where organizations can keep track of their fundraising campaigns. This page allows organizations to easily share their campaigns to solicit more donations and track their fundraising progress in real-time.
